##Sudoku Game Tutorial
I copied, step by step, the code for a sudoku game. 
This tutorial is on Youtube from freeCodeCamp.org. 
The code is in Java and uses JavaFx for the GUI.

My goal with this project is to become more familiar with Java and OOP
through exposure to quality UI design and simple game logic.
This is purely a learning tool. The code is very heavily commented.
Most of this is info I found valuable from the creator as they 
verbalized their thought process during the coding.

###Things I Learned about

- JavaFx
- Hash Maps
- Interfaces
-
